# Efficient Conversion of Random Bits To Random Numbers of BaseN

A script to explore the efficiency of converting longer chunks of random bits to a sequence of baseN random numbers.

Read about the rejection sampling method used to convert random bits to random baseN digits [here][rsm].

Read about the increased efficiency of this method when converting more than the minimal amount of bits at a time [here][long-chunks].
